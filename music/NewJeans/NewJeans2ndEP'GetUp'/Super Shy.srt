1
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I'm super shy, super shy
But wait a minute while I make you mine, make you mine

2
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:25,240
떨리는 지금도 you're on my mind all the time
I wanna tell you, but I'm super shy, super shy

3
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:31,100
I'm super shy, super shy
But wait a minute while I make you mine, make you mine

4
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:38,080
떨리는 지금도 you're on my mind all the time
I wanna tell you, but I'm super shy, super shy

5
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:43,230
And I wanna go out with you, where you wanna go? (Huh?)
Find a lil' spot, just sit and talk

6
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:50,000
Looking pretty, follow me, 우리 둘이 나란히
보이지? 내 눈이 갑자기 빛나지 when you say I'm your dream

7
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:56,770
You don't even know my name, do you?

8
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:02,360
You don't even know my name, do you?

9
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:04,640
누구보다도

10
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:09,500
I'm super shy, super shy
But wait a minute while I make you mine, make you mine

11
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:16,560
떨리는 지금도 you're on my mind all the time
I wanna tell you, but I'm super shy, super shy

12
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:22,270
I'm super shy, super shy
But wait a minute while I make you mine, make you mine

13
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:29,430
떨리는 지금도 you're on my mind all the time
I wanna tell you, but I'm super shy, super shy

14
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:34,390
나 원래 말도 잘하고 그런데 왜 이런지?
I don't like that

15
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:42,360
Something odd about you, yeah, you're special and you know it
You're the top, babe

16
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:47,630
I'm super shy, super shy
But wait a minute while I make you mine, make you mine

17
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:55,300
떨리는 지금도 you're on my mind all the time
I wanna tell you, but I'm super shy, super shy

18
00:01:55,530 --> 00:02:00,330
I'm super shy, super shy
But wait a minute while I make you mine, make you mine

19
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:07,890
떨리는 지금도 you're on my mind all the time
I wanna tell you, but I'm super shy, super shy

20
00:08:540 --> 00:02:12,110
You don't even know my name, do you?

21
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:18,490
You don't even know my name, do you?

22
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:20,890
누구보다도

23
00:21:460 --> 00:02:33,929
You don't even know my name (super shy, super shy)
Do you? (Make you mine, make you mine)

24
00:27:360 --> 00:34,000
You don't even know my name (you're on my mind all the time, I wanna tell you)
Do you? (But I'm super shy, I'm super shy)
